Online Shopping Simulator

This Python program is a simplified online shopping simulator. It includes classes to represent products, manage orders, and calculate total costs. Users can add products to their cart, view order details, and determine the overall bill. It serves as a basic example for learning object-oriented programming in Python and can be a starting point for more complex e-commerce systems.
